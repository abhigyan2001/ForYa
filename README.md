# ForYa

An experimental project trying to create a Fourier Series and Transform visualizer for continuous and discrete data, with plans to support Real-Time signal inputs as well.

## The Aim

The aim here is to create a visualizer which is able to perform basic Signal Processing extremely well while also learning to use more Python modules for creating a GUI-based application like this.
